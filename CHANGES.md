## v1.1.0+1.21.5
- Now compatible with both Fabric and NeoForge!
  - All thanks to the [Mutliloader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template) by @jaredlll08
- Add Emerald blocks as a beacon case, providing the Luck effect
- Change how disabling the GUI works so it doesn't disable all interactions
  - This allows you to place blocks against the beacon and allows interactions from other mods
